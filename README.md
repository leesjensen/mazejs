Maze.js
======

Javascript implementation of a maze generator, solver, and interactive play. This Maze.js uses pure javascript (no additional libraries). The purpose of the code is to provide a simple environment where you can learn to write javascript by implementing a maze generator or maze solver. You can then interactively play the maze or compare the difficulty of your generator or efficency of your solver against other implementations.

## To Do
* Add timers that are displayed
* Make generators and solvers pluggable in order to test different engines as a competition. 
* Use each generator in turn and then execute each runner.
  * For each runner display:
    * Number of trace nodes left behind.
    * Time taken to execute.
  * For each generator calculate its complexity by displaying the average result from all runners.
* Allow multiple players
