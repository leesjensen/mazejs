JSMaze
======

Javascript implementation of a maze generator, solver, and interactive play. This JSMaze only uses pure javascript (no additional libraries). The purpose of the code is to provide a simple environment where you can learn to write javascript by implementing a maze generator or maze solver. You can then interactively play the maze or compare the difficulty of your generator or efficency of your solver against other implementations.

## To Do
* Allow multiple players
* Add timers that are displayed
* Make generators and solvers pluggable in order to test different engines as a competition.
